Henceforth, replication materials were to be made available to the AEA prior to acceptance - previously, it was prior to publication, but after acceptance. Computer code should be provided for all stages of the data cleaning and data analysis (code for the data cleaning portion was previously optional). Raw data must be uniformly made available, when permissions allow (also for author-collected survey data, data from experiments). For restricted-access or proprietary data, to the extent permissible, the data must be made available to the AEA Data Editor for verification, even if the data cannot be published by the author.1 Enforcement of an existing but unenforced data citation requirement as per AEA Citation Guidelines. We also test licenses, access restrictions, and sometimes question the ability of authors to publish the data. We have had cases both ways: data provided after initial refusal, and data rejected by us because the license did not allow distribution. For now, we also check for obvious personally identifiable information (PII). However, the ultimate responsibility lies with authors. All data and code must be available in a &quot;trusted repository,&quot; which in most cases means the AEA's Data and Code Repository at openICPSR, for better transparency and findability. ZIP files are no longer accepted as supplementary packages, and we check that. Supplements are tagged with JEL codes, other keywords (e.g., &quot;Current Population Survey&quot; or &quot;behavioral study&quot;), and optionally with methodological information (time period, geographic region, survey method used). Each deposit gets its own DOI - a permanent unique identifier. Deposits can be found through various search engines, such as the native search engine on openICPSR, through Google Data Search or through DOI registries such as DataCite. To implement all this, we built a system using Jira, and connect to it from ScholarOne (system used for manuscript submission) and openICPSR. 4.1 Activities of the LDI Replication Lab The LDI Replication Lab conducts reproducibility checks in two way. 4.1.1 Pre-Publication Evaluation of Reproducibility and Quality of Supplemental Materials The Lab performs pre-publication evaluation for the American Economic Association, i.e., prior to publication. Think of it as a &quot;reviewer&quot; of the data supplement. Analyze the provided materials - see Verification guidance Verify data citations Verify ability to post data (do the authors have the right to post the data?) If possible, attempt replication 4.1.2 Post-Publication Evaluation of Reproducibility We download articles and supplements, assess to what extent an undergraduate student can run the code that produces the analysis reported in the paper. We have also in the past done an evaluation of the response of authors when the code is only available &quot;upon request&quot;. Not currently an active project. This is a secondary goal, as time permits or as research goals suggest. It is quite similar to the first goal, but there is no interaction with authors, and no method to improve authors' files. Interested parties might visit ACRE for how to incorporate this kind of activity into a class curriculum. 4.2 Learning goals In this training, you will learn how to verify compliance with the policy. This means going through a variety of checklists, obtaining data, and running code, as per instructions provided by authors. You will not be required to actively program, but you will learn a lot about how to program (and sometimes, how not to program). You will gain an appreciation for a well-structured empirical analysis, which you will benefit from for your own studies (now) and in your work (after graduation). References "],["basic-concepts.html", "Chapter 5 Basic Concepts", " Chapter 5 Basic Concepts The goal thus of the reproducibility activity is to verify provenance of all data sources, to verify the availability of all computer code to produce analysis files from data sources, and to produce tables, figures, and in-text numbers from analysis files, to verify that the available code actually reproduces the analysis files, tables, figures, and in-text numbers. We therefore need to define a few concepts: what is a data source, and how can one verify its provenance? what is analysis data? how can we verify computational reproducibility? The subsequent chapters will explore each of these in additional detail. "],["data-citations-and-data-availability-statements.html", "Chapter 6 Data citations and data availability statements 6.1 A very short history of data citations 6.2 How do you create a data citation 6.3 Data availability statements", " Chapter 6 Data citations and data availability statements Most students and researchers have been trained to cite their sources. Mostly, this is meant to be literature sources, but the basic idea applies just as much to data: If you use somebody else's data, you should acknowledge that. 6.1 A very short history of data citations The almost complete absence of data citations from the literature has lead to issues when data creators and data providers attempt to assess their impact on science. Typically, they revert to manually or algorithmically scouring the literature, trying to find instances where their data is used. In 2016, a number of scientists and publishers from many domains got together and issued the FAIR Data principles (FORCE11 2016). &quot;FAIR&quot; is an acronym for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable These are principles which help the furthering of increased reproducibility - by making data accessible, reproducibility checks can be conducted. By making them interoperable and re-usable, others can reproduce, replicate, and expand on the original research. Findability remains an issue: how do you discover data that is hidden in a ZIP file on a journal website as part of an (otherwise) perfectly reproducible package? In fact, the same group had previously laid the groundwork to that. In 2014, they issued the &quot;Data Citation Principles (DCP)&quot; (Martone 2014). These laid out the ethical need for such citations, the content such citations should have, and some desirable attributes of data citations. Both the DCP as well as FAIR suggest that data be assigned unique identifiers, allowing them to be clearly referenced, and found. The most common identifier in the social sciences is the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), but others exist, in particular in the biological or physical sciences. DCPrinciples The DCC note that (emphasis added): Sound, reproducible scholarship rests upon a foundation of robust, accessible data. For this to be so in practice as well as theory, data must be accorded due importance in the practice of scholarship and in the enduring scholarly record. In other words, data should be considered legitimate, citable products of research. Data citation, like the citation of other evidence and sources, is good research practice and is part of the scholarly ecosystem supporting data reuse. Data citation increases the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and re-usability of research data (FAIR). Through data citations, data providers can link to articles (sometimes automatically), allowing them to show the academic value of the data and continue providing the services around data creation. Finally, data citations open a new path to finding relevant science, by reaching the linked articles through data search interfaces, like openICPSR, Data-Pass, and Google Dataset Search. These principles are imperfectly implemented even today. Many data providers, including some of the biggest statistical agencies, do not provide unique identifiers to a particular data file. Some might uniquely identify a data series. Others may heuristically refer to certain versions (&quot;V2&quot;). Few have robust archival quality unique identifiers. Journals' stylistic considerations also reduce the impact of the DCC. Citations - in the sense of appearing in a bibliography at the end of the document - do not provide much sense of any access method other than a download. The AEA follows the Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS), with several additions on the AEA website. BLS citation at AEA As the CMOS states, one of the criteria for a useful citation is conveying authority and permanence: Electronic content presented without formal ties to a publisher or sponsoring body has the authority equivalent to that of unpublished or self-published material in other media. FAIR data helps convey such information, but often, assessing what &quot;publisher&quot; or &quot;sponsoring body&quot; is reputable or reliable is tricky. And the citation fails to convey many important facets of data access. What if the cited resource requires a login, even if it is free? What if payment is required? What if a long-winding application process is required? Citations do not communicate that amount of detail. As we shall see later, there are ways to augment data citations with the needed information. 6.2 How do you create a data citation ICPSR (ICPSR 2020) notes that a citation should include the following items: Author Title Distributor Date Version Persistent identifier where any data source has the first five elements, and the ideal FAIR curated data source also has a persistent identifier. 6.2.1 An imperfect real example Consider the BLS citation shown earlier: Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2000–2010. “Current Employment Statistics: Colorado, Total Nonfarm, Seasonally adjusted - SMS08000000000000001.” United States Department of Labor. http://data.bls.gov/cgi- bin/surveymost?sm+08 (accessed February 9, 2011). The author or creator is clearly Bureau of Labor Statistics. The distributor here is United States Department of Labor, which happens to be the government department housing the BLS. Title is arguably Current Employment Statistics: Colorado, Total Nonfarm, Seasonally adjusted, though some might argue that state, coverage, and seasonal adjustment identify versions of the survey. Date are the (original) dates of publication, or here, approximated by the date range covered by the series. But generally, versions relates to a chronologically released version - which is less clear in this case, and only captured by (accessed February 9, 2011). There is no clear persistent identifier, the closest approximation is provided by a combination of the series identifier SMS08000000000000001, the URL http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?sm+08, and the date accessed (accessed February 9, 2011). Note that this is imperfect, because, unless you can time-travel, you cannot obtain the same dataset a second time. Attribute Value Author: Bureau of Labor Statistics Title: Current Employment Statistics: Colorado, Total Nonfarm, Seasonally adjusted Distributor: United States Department of Labor Date: 2000-2010 Version: (accessed February 9, 2011) Persistent identifier: SMS08000000000000001 + http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?sm+08 + (accessed February 9, 2011) 6.2.2 An ideal (?) data citation What should the ideal data citation look like? ICPSR suggests Barnes, Samuel H. Italian Mass Election Survey, 1968. Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research distributor, 1992-02-16. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR07953.v1 so that Attribute Value Author: Barnes, Samuel H. Title: Italian Mass Election Survey, 1968 Distributor: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research Date: 1992-02-16 Version: V1 Persistent identifier: 10.3886/ICPSR07953.v1 Note that the date 1968 describes the survey, but its date of publication was 1992. The version is implicit in the DOI. The persistent identifier is just 10.3886/ICPSR07953.v1, but the display guidelines for DOI suggest including the full URL that yields a resolution. 6.2.3 Data citation template In general, therefore, as long as you can fill out the table Attribute Value Author: Title: Distributor: Date: Version: Persistent identifier: you can create a data citation: [AUTHOR], &quot;[TITLE]&quot;, DISTRIBUTOR, [DATE], [VERSION] + [Persistent Identifier] 6.2.4 A not quite serious example Many authors initially neglect to add data citations, or do not know how to add a data citation. Often, we see authors cite papers with supplementary data, but not databases or other data: We use data acquired from the NHL, dates of power outages collected by Tremblay et al (2018), augmented with information on the language and grammar skills of hockey players provided by the Ethnologue database. (note absence of citation for NHL and Ethnologue data). In the above example, three datasets are used, but only one is cited in some fashion. 6.2.4.1 Better The above example can be improved as follows: We use data acquired from the NHL (NHL, 2018), dates of power outages collected by Tremblay et al (2018, 2019), augmented with information on the language and grammar skills of hockey players provided by the Ethnologue database (Eberhard et al, 2019). with the reference list having the following entries: Eberhard, David M., Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2019. Ethnologue: Languages of the World. Twenty-second edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com. National Hockey League. 2018. NHL Game Database 1917-2018. National Hockey League Hall of Fame, Toronto, ON. Accessed February 29, 2019. Tremblay, Réjean, Ken Dryden, and José Theodore. 2018. &quot;The impact of power outages on goal-keeping in the NHL&quot;, Journal of National Hockey Leagues, vol 32, iss. 1. Tremblay, Réjean, Ken Dryden, and José Theodore. 2019. &quot;Power outages during NHL games (updated)&quot;, Canadian Hockey Dataverse, doi:10.1234/nhl.lnh.haha Assess why the latter is better. 6.2.5 Data distributed as supplementary data The CMOS provides examples of how to cite supplementary materials that are attached to a specific article: Suárez-Rodríguez, M. and C. Macías Garcia. 2014. &quot;There Is No Such a Thing as a Free Cigarette: Lining Nests with Discarded Butts Brings Short-Term Benefits, but Causes Toxic Damage.&quot; Journal of Evolutionary Biology 27, no. 12 (December 2014): 2719–26, https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.12531, data deposited at Dryad Digital Repository, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4t5rt. The AEA guidance used to provide an example, in which the citation links to the article landing page: Romer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks: Dataset.” American Economic Review. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.3.763. Many authors, however, would only cite the article itself, and not the data. Note however that modern data citation guidance suggest that both the article and the data used by the article should be cited, and this can lead to confusion. With the 2019 move of the AEA to a data archive, the correct citation for the above supplement would be: Romer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. &quot;Replication data for: The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks.&quot; American Economic Association [publisher], * Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research distributor*, https://doi.org/10.3886/E112357V1 with the article also cited as: Romer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks” American Economic Review. no. 3 (June 2010): 763–801. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.3.763. 6.2.6 Producer Often, the creator of a dataset is an organization. The same way that an organization as a work's author can be cited: ISO (International Organization for Standardization). 1997. Information and Documentation—Rules for the Abbreviation of Title Words and Titles of Publications. ISO 4:1997. Paris: ISO. an organization can be cited as the creator of a dataset: Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P). 2017. Compustat-Capital IQ. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. 6.2.7 Distributor In many cases, the data are not distributed by the creator. This means the distributor takes on the role of a publisher (of a book, of data). In the BLS example, the two differed only because the (higher-ranking) department counts as the distributor. In the case of Compustat, one might have obtained access through the Wharton Research Data Services, and cite as Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P). 2017. Compustat-Capital IQ. Wharton Research Data Services. https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/about/data-vendors/sp-global-market-intelligence/ If using the S&amp;P 500 data, there may be multiple providers: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&amp;P 500 [SP500], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SP500, January 24, 2020. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&amp;P 500, provided via Haver Analytics Data Subscription, February 24, 2018. with hopefully the same content. Note that often, such data is subject to copyright and redistribution restrictions (see the page at FRED on SP500 and discussion in the later section). 6.2.8 Dates In some cases, it isn't clear when the dataset was published, though it may be clear what time period the dataset covers (as in the BLS case). One way to address this may be by using the &quot;n.d.&quot; abbreviation for the date of publication and including the date of coverage in the title: Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P). n.d. Compustat-Capital IQ (1982-2017). Wharton Research Data Services. Accessed April 6, 2018. https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/about/data-vendors/sp-global-market-intelligence/ A related issue may arise when the dataset is comprised of multiple years, each of which has its own DOI. For instance, when accessing multiple years of American Community Survey data on ICPSR, each has its own DOI: American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1998 (ICPSR 3888) 2008-05-21 American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1997 (ICPSR 3886) 2008-05-21 American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 2003 (ICPSR 4117) 2009-12-01 American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 2004 (ICPSR 4370) 2008-10-14 American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 2009 (ICPSR 33802) 2013-04-04 American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 2008 (ICPSR 29263) 2011-11-08 One approach to this is to create a composite citation, with additional information available in an online data appendix or a Data Availability Statement: Bureau Of The Census. 2009. “American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1997-2009.” United States Department Of Commerce [publisher]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. distributor DOIs listed in data appendix. or Bureau Of The Census. 2009. “American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1997-2009.” United States Department Of Commerce [publisher]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. distributor https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/search/studies?q=american+community+survey (accessed November 21, 2019) (and listing of exact DOIs in an appendix table). 6.2.9 Offline access mechanism Many datasets are available only under license, memorandum, contract, etc., and do not have a formal online presence. This is quite similar to traditional offline archives, for instance manuscript collections. For such collections, CMOS suggests: Kallen, Horace. Papers. YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, New York. Merriam, Charles E. Papers. Special Collections Research Center, box 26, folder 17. University of Chicago Library. and usage in the text as Alvin Johnson, in a memorandum prepared sometime in 1937 (Kallen Papers, file 36), observed that ... Similar citations can be constructed for offline databases: Bloom, Nick. 2019. Confidential survey data on Cameroon business processes. Stanford Secure Access Center (file &quot;cameroon-bloom.zip&quot;). Stanford University. 6.2.10 Confidential databases Similar forms may be used for confidential databases when no DOI exists: Internal Revenue Service. (YEAR). Corporate Income Tax Returns [database]. Department of Treasury, Washington DC, accessed YYYY-MM-DD. where the data, in this case, were accessed via the &quot;Department of Treasury,&quot; acting as a secure distributor (of access, not downloads). If the same data had been accessed via a secure research data center, the reference should have instead noted that access mechanism: Internal Revenue Service. (YEAR). Corporate Income Tax Returns [database]. Federal Research Data Centers, last accessed YYYY-MM-DD. 6.2.10.1 Confidential data with DOI If a DOI exists, of course, the formal citation generated from that DOI should be used: Forschungsdatenzentrum der Bundesagentur für Arbeit. 2020. “Betriebs-Historik-Panel (BHP) – Version 7518 v1.” Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB). https://doi.org/10.5164/IAB.BHP7518.DE.EN.V1. 6.2.11 No formal access mechanism In some cases (not infrequently), access to data is through informal means. The CMOS allows for citation of such information, without inclusion in the references. (A. P. Møller, unpublished data; C. R. Brown and M. B. Brown, unpublished data) We would deviate from that suggestion, ask for inclusion in the reference list, and simply suggest using unpublished data as the locator, similar to a URN, in the reference list: Møller, A. P. n.d. “Data on Crocodile Sightings in Manhattan.” unpublished data. Accessed February 29, 2019. 6.2.12 Unknown or confidential author In some cases, the authors might not be able to name the data creator, due to a non-disclosure agreement. One suggestion may then be Anonymous Firm, n.d. &quot;Data on financial transactions.&quot; Accessed under Non-disclosure Agreement, extract obtained on January 20, 2016. 6.2.13 Where to cite In all cases, data and code should be cited in the main manuscript. They should also be referenced in the data availability statement (some journals) or the README (other journals). However, in some cases, data is only used in an online appendix, and it is acceptable to cite the data there as well, and not in the main manuscript's bibliography. Furthermore, as data citation are still a relatively new concept, many authors will have substantially completed their manuscript, without including data citations. Adding them to the README is then acceptable practice (for now). 6.3 Data availability statements The academic publishing community's response are &quot;data availability statements (DAS).&quot; While mostly, these are pointers from the journal to where the data can be found. In the case of data supplements, this is almost trivial when the journal has a robust data availability policy, though some journals allow for self-declared but unverified DAS. Summarily, a data availability statement describes not just where the data can be obtained from, but also how the data can be obtained, conditions for obtaining it, and any additional restrictions. Some examples are provided by Springer/Nature and Hindawi: Springer Hindawi 6.3.1 Some examples of DAS 6.3.1.1 Example for public use data included in data archive: The paper uses data obtained from IPUMS (Ruggles et al, 2017). IPUMS-CPS does not currently provide the ability to store or reference custom extracts, but allows for redistribution for the purpose of replication. The archive contains the extracted data, codebook in the folder &quot;data/IPUMS&quot;. The data citation in the main article has the full URL. 6.3.1.2 Example for public use data not included in data archive: Data from the Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural Urban Geographic Dataset on India, Version 1.0 (Asher and Novosad, 2019) is used in this paper. The full dataset and documentation can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DPESAK. 6.3.1.3 Example for public use data with required permission: The paper uses IPUMS Terra data. IPUMS-Terra does not allow for redistribution, except for the purpose of replication archives. Permissions as per https://terra.ipums.org/citation have been obtained, and are documented within the &quot;data/IPUMS-terra&quot; folder. 6.3.1.4 Example for confidential data: The data for this project are confidential, but may be obtained with Data Use Agreements with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). Researchers interested in access to the data may contact [NAME] at [EMAIL], also see www.doe.mass.edu/research/contact.html. It can take some months to negotiate data use agreements and gain access to the data. The author will assist with any reasonable replication attempts for two years following publication. 6.3.1.5 Example for Government registers In some cases, governments have a list of their (named) registers. For instance, Statistics Denmark provides the full list of registers at http://www.dst.dk/extranet/forskningvariabellister/Oversigt%20over%20registre.html. These can be used to craft data citations (see Data citation guidance). Data availability statements should describe how each such register can be accessed: The information used in the analysis combines several Danish administrative registers (as described in the paper). The data use is subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) per new Danish regulations from May 2018. The data are physically stored on computers at Statistics Denmark and, due to security considerations, the data may not be transferred to computers outside Statistics Denmark. Researchers interested in obtaining access to the register data employed in this paper are required to submit a written application to gain approval from Statistics Denmark. The application must include a detailed description of the proposed project, its purpose, and its social contribution, as well as a description of the required datasets, variables, and analysis population. Applications can be submitted by researchers who are affiliated with Danish institutions accepted by Statistics Denmark, or by researchers outside of Denmark who collaborate with researchers affiliated with these institutions. (Example taken from Fadlon and Nielsen, 2020 (forthcoming as of June 2020). 6.3.1.6 S&amp;P 500 The S&amp;P 500 is one of the most widely known stock indexes. And yet, it is subject to copyright, and restrictions on redistribution. Some authors who use the S&amp;P 500 numbers may have downloaded it via FRED https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SP500, others through other data services (Haver Analytics, Bloomberg). The FRED website mentions that the data are S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC. Reproduction of S&amp;P 500 in any form is prohibited except with the prior written permission of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (&quot;S&amp;P&quot;). If obtained through FRED, the suggested citation is S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&amp;P 500 [SP500], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SP500, January 24, 2020. An analogue if accessing it through, say, Haver Analytics, might be S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&amp;P 500, provided via Haver Analytics, January 24, 2020. Note that both citations do not provide (complete) information on how others might obtain the data, and what restrictions are imposed on the data (unless they visit the site, or read the terms of use of, say, their Haver Analytics description). A tentative Data Availability Statement might be: S&amp;P 500 data is (C) S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC. Reproduction of S&amp;P 500 in any form is prohibited except with the prior written permission of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (&quot;S&amp;P&quot;). It is thus not available as part of the replication archive. Users may access the past 10 years via FRED at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SP500, or purchase longer access via Haver Analytics (http://www.haver.com/databaseprofiles.html#indicators).

References "],["generic-data-workflow.html", "Chapter 7 Generic data workflow 7.1 Details on data workflows 7.2 A simple example", " Chapter 7 Generic data workflow In a very generic, all empirical analysis goes through the following steps: acquiring data (primary or secondary) cleaning data (reformatting, standardizing, dropping) to create analysis data analyzing data and reporting results in tables, figures, and in-text numbers. 7.1 Details on data workflows In a reproducible workflow, instructions to perform all of the above are provided. Most of the time, those instructions will be computer code, to be interpreted using statistical software, in some cases to be compiled into executables (C++, Fortran). Sometimes, the data acquisition might also be coded - using software packages or scripts to download, or through computer-assisted surveys or experiments, but more often, acquiring data entails manual actions. For instance, secondary data access might be described in Data Availability Statements, whereas primary data acquisition might be described in survey documentation, field guides, and in experiment instructions.2 Once analysis data is created, the analysis programs generate output that is then embedded in the article. Often, that output might be ready-made tables and figures, but sometimes, authors will manually transcode output from log files into tables. Modern reproducible documents will capture such output and embed it into a document directly. The following diagram illustrates the generic flow: &lt;div class=&quot;mermaid&quot;&gt; graph TD; subgraph Dataflow; A((Input data)) ==&gt; B[Cleaning programs]; B ==&gt; C((Analysis data)); C ==&gt; D[Analysis programs] D ==&gt; E((Outputs)); end; B -.-&gt; F((&quot;Auxiliary data&lt;br/&gt;(created)&quot;)); F -.-&gt; C; Z((Source)) -.-&gt; X[Data citation] -.-&gt; A; &lt;/div&gt; Real articles are often more complex. A simple example will be discussed next. 7.2 A simple example At the Github repository labordynamicsinstitute/simple-example, we have prepared a very simple example of a data analysis workflow. It illustrates the concepts above. Read the README before going on. We focus on the information provided in the README first: Source: Census of Population and Housing, 2000 The source data is identified, and a data citation is provided as part of the README. The README notes that the data is considered public-use, but a login is required at ICPSR, which is the distributor of the data. The data acquisition, as described, is a manual process (because it requires a login). The data is also manually unzipped, and the final location described. Note: this could be scripted to make part of the data acquisition code-driven. Cleaning programs: 01_dataclean.do A cleaning program is identified and described. Analysis data: is verbally described in the README (&quot;clean merged dataset&quot;) Note: Could this be improved? Analysis program: 02_table1.do Outputs: Table 1 An analysis program is also listed, and identified as creating output Table 1. An inspection of the &quot;manuscript&quot; shows that only a single table is included. So a flow diagram for the simple example might be: &lt;div class=&quot;mermaid&quot;&gt; graph TD; subgraph Dataflow; A((&quot;Input data:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;ICPSR_13568-V1&quot;&lt;/i&gt;)) ==&gt; B[&quot;Cleaning programs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;01_dataclean.do&lt;/i&gt;&quot;]; B ==&gt; C((Analysis data)); C ==&gt; D[&quot;Analysis programs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;02_table1.do&lt;/i&gt;&quot;] D ==&gt; E((&quot;Outputs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Table 1&lt;/i&gt;&quot;)); end; Z((&quot;Source:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Decennial Census&quot;)) -.-&gt; X[Data citation] -.-&gt; A; &lt;/div&gt; Note that when the authors generate or collect primary data, subsequent users of the same data are secondary data users, but replication might also involve re-executing the experiment, or collecting data anew with the same survey instruments.↩ "],["assessing-computational-reproducibility.html", "Chapter 8 Assessing computational reproducibility", " Chapter 8 Assessing computational reproducibility The basic workflow is simple: obtain the pre-publication manuscript and any materials analyze the README, and possibly appendixes and data sections, to identify all data sources, and all processing instructions obtain all code obtain all data execute all code compare the output with the manuscript tables, figures, and in-text In practice, this quickly becomes more complicated, and requires a multitude of if-then instructions. At the LDI Lab, we have implemented the generic workflow within a system called Jira, which replicators use to go through the steps above. A complete workflow for reproducibility checks At each step, additional information is requested, mostly through in-app fields and questionnaires, but also via some external tools if the Jira app did not provide the functionality. At the end, a report is created by the replicator, identifying all steps taken, which steps succeeded, and the final outcome. We will first describe the prototypical report and its elements, and then walk through the detailed steps of the replicator's journey through the system. In our live training, replicators will also work on examples to &quot;get the hang of it.&quot; "],["a-guided-walk-through-the-replication-report.html", "Chapter 9 A guided walk through the Replication Report 9.1 Some high-level concepts 9.2 Annotated REPLICATION.md 9.3 Some additional materials", " Chapter 9 A guided walk through the Replication Report In order to work through a replication report, you will need Access to computers Reviewed the Template REPORT We have examples of various actual reports (slightly anonymized): Example 1 Example 2 Example 3 and its revision 9.1 Some high-level concepts 9.1.1 (30 min) Data documentation Identifying all data What is great / good / just-good-enough data documentation Citing data! 9.1.2 (30 min) Code and documentation What do we consider to be &quot;code&quot; Assessing the quality of the code documentation How to modify code for replicability/verification 9.2 Annotated REPLICATION.md You may want to consult Unofficial Verification Guidance for additional tips and criteria. 9.2.1 SUMMARY INSTRUCTION: The Data Editor will fill this part out. It will be based on any [REQUIRED] and [SUGGESTED] action items that the report makes a note of. INSTRUCTION: ALWAYS do &quot;Data description&quot;, &quot;Code description&quot;. If data is present, ALWAYS do &quot;Data checks&quot;. If time is sufficient (initial assessment!), do &quot;Replication steps&quot;, if not, explain why not. 9.2.2 Data description (raw data) INSTRUCTIONS: Identify all data sources. Create a list (and commit the list together with this report) (not needed if filling out the &quot;Data Citation and Information report&quot;). For each data source, list in THIS document presence or absence of source, codebook/information on the data, and summary statistics. Summary statistics and codebook may not be necessary if they are available for public use data. In all cases, if the author of the article points to an online location for such information, that is OK. Check for data citation. IN THIS DOCUMENT, point out only a summary of shortcomings. 9.2.3 Data description (analysis data) INSTRUCTIONS: List the analysis data files provided. These will be the datasets that are read by the table/figure generating programs. Sometimes, cleaning and analysis are done in one step (no intermediate analysis data exists). 9.2.3.1 ICPSR data deposit INSTRUCTIONS: Most deposits will be at openICPSR, but all need to be checked for complete metadata. Detailed guidance is at https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea-guidance.html. openICPSR metadata [ ] JEL Classification (required) [ ] Manuscript Number (required) [ ] Subject Terms (highly recommended) [ ] Geographic coverage (highly recommended) [ ] Time period(s) (highly recommended) [ ] Collection date(s) (suggested) [ ] Universe (suggested) [ ] Data Type(s) (suggested) [ ] Data Source (suggested) [ ] Units of Observation (suggested) INSTRUCTIONS: Go through the checklist above, and then choose ONE of the following results: NOTE openICPSR metadata is sufficient. or [REQUIRED] Please update the required fields listed. and/or [SUGGESTED] We suggest you update the fields marked as (suggested) above, in order to improve findability of your data and code supplement. For additional guidance, see https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea-guidance.html. 9.2.4 Data checks INSTRUCTIONS: When data are present, run checks: - can data be read (using software indicated by author)? Is data in archive-ready formats (CSV, TXT) or in custom formats (DTA, SAS7BDAT, Rdata)? Does the data have variable labels (Stata: run describe using (name of DTA) and check that there is content in the column &quot;variable label&quot;)? Run check for PII (PII_stata_scan.do, sourced from here if using Stata) and report results. Note: this check will have lots of false positives - fields it thinks might be sensitive that are not, in fact, sensitive. Apply judgement. Note that we have NOT required that variable values are here, nor that a full codebook is present or linked. Ideally, these would be here as well, and in some cases, we will go back to the authors and request them, IF we think it is reasonable to do so (judgement call). 9.2.5 Code description INSTRUCTIONS: Review the code (but do not run it yet). INSTRUCTIONS: Cleaning code: Is there code that transforms the raw data files (listed above) into the (provided) analysis data? INSTRUCTIONS: Analysis code: Identify all Figure, Table, and any in-text numbers. Create a list, mapping each of them to a particular program and line number within the program (use this template). Commit that list. You will come back to the list in your findings. IN THIS SECTION, point out only a summary description, including of shortcomings. E.g. There are four provided Stata do files, three Matlab .m files, including a &quot;master.do&quot;. - Table 5: could not identify code that produces Table 5 - Neither the program codes, nor the README, identify which tables are produced by what program. INSTRUCTIONS: You could generate list of all code files using the (Git) Bash shell: find . -name \\*.do will find all files ending in .do. That list can be provided. programs/master.do programs/table1.do programs/table2.do programs/figure1.do programs/table3.do programs/table4.m programs/figure2.m NOTE: In-text numbers that reference numbers in tables do not need to be listed. Only in-text numbers that correspond to no table or figure need to be listed. What can go wrong? Not all code is provided. Frequently missing: Appendix code Transforming raw data into analysis data Code does not identify where specific tables/figures/numbers are created Ideally: one program per table/figure, called from master program Also feasible: Labels within the programs Issues: no labels Mnemonic tables without numbering (table_ols_fe.csv) No comments at all... 9.2.6 Replication steps INSTRUCTIONS: provide details about your process of accessing the code and data. Do NOT detail things like &quot;I save them on my Desktop&quot;. DO describe actions that you did as per instructions (&quot;I added a config.do&quot;) DO describe any other actions you needed to do (&quot;I had to make changes in multiple programs&quot;), without going into detail (the commit log can provide that information) Example: 1. Downloaded code from URL provided. 2. Downloaded data from URL indicated in the README. A sign-up was required (not indicated in README) 3. Added the config.do generating system information, but commented out log creation, as author already creates log files. 4. Ran code as per README, but the third step did not work. 5. Made changes to the way the third step is run to get it to work. 9.2.7 Computing Environment INSTRUCTIONS: This might be automated, for now, please fill in manually. Remove examples that are not relevant, adjust examples to fit special circumstances. Some of this is available from the standard log output in Stata. These can be found by right-clicking on &quot;My PC&quot; (for a PC), &quot;About this Mac&quot; (for a Mac), and a combination of &quot;free -g&quot; and &quot;cat /proc/cpuinfo&quot; on Linux.

You can re-use the Excel file created under Code Description. When errors happen, be as precise as possible. For differences in figures, provide both a screenshot of what the manuscript contains, as well as the figure produced by the code you ran. 9.2.8.1 Tables Table 1: Looks the same Table 2: (contains no data) Table 3: Minor differences in row 5, column 3: Reproduced: 0.003 Manuscript: 0.3 9.2.8.2 Figures INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a comparison with the paper when describing that figures look different. Use a screenshot for the paper, and the graph generated by the programs for the comparison. Reference the graph generated by the programs as a local file within the repository. Example: - Figure 1: Looks the same - Figure 2: no program provided - Figure 3: Paper version looks different from the one generated by programs: Paper version: Figure 3 generated by programs: Replicated version 9.2.8.3 In-Text Numbers INSTRUCTIONS: list page and line number of in-text numbers. If ambiguous, cite the surrounding text, i.e., &quot;the rate fell to 52% of all jobs: verified&quot;. [ ] There are no in-text numbers, or all in-text numbers stem from tables and figures. [ ] There are in-text numbers, but they are not identified in the code Example: - Page 21, line 5: Same 9.2.9 Classification INSTRUCTIONS: Make an assessment here. Full replication can include a small number of apparently insignificant changes in the numbers in the table. Full replication also applies when changes to the programs needed to be made, but were successfully implemented. Partial replication means that a significant number (&gt;25%) of programs and/or numbers are different. Note that if any data is confidential and not available, then a partial replication applies. This should be noted on the &quot;Replication assessment questionnaire&quot;/ JIRA. Note that when all data is confidential, it is unlikely that this exercise should have been attempted. Failure to replicate: only a small number of programs ran successfully, or only a small number of numbers were successfully generated (&lt;25%) [ ] full replication [ ] full replication with minor issues [ ] partial replication (see above) [ ] not able to replicate most or all of the results (reasons see above) 9.3 Some additional materials Here's a collection from older presentations: Elements of a replication report Replicator checklist "],["privacy.html", "A Privacy A.1 Privacy of Replicators A.2 The Privacy of Authors", " A Privacy We need to cover two sorts of privacy: the privacy of those whose materials we verify, and your own privacy. There are limitations to both, but we attempt to protect privacy as much as possible. A.1 Privacy of Replicators You are tasked with reproducing articles. Much as referees for journals mostly remain anonymous, we want you to remain anonymous as well. You may reveal yourself to authors later (after the task is completed), if you wish. You should not contact authors unless authorized by the Lab Leader. Normally, all such communications go through the Lab Leader. We do name you (to thank you) in the annual report, but do not attribute your work to any one article. In the empirical analysis of all the articles, we replace your netid and name with an anonymous (and untraceable) identifier. So we can track that you have done Articles A1, D57, and Z31, but nobody knows that it was you. There is &quot;leakage&quot; of information: In order to download materials, you need to login to openICPSR, and have the ability to download from specific deposits. This does reveal your name to the depositors. This is currently a technological constraint, and cannot be avoided without great complications. If you have concerns, please let us know, and we will find a workaround. Should you ever be contacted in some unacceptable fashion by authors, you should immediately contact the Lab Leadership. You can, and you should, reveal your affiliation with this project! You can (and you should) be proud of the work you will do or have done, and you are allowed (and you should) reference this project as an accomplishment. A.2 The Privacy of Authors When we do pre-publication verification, this is equally important. You are never allowed to reveal that the author has submitted to the journal This includes when you need to contact third parties for materials that are part of the replication materials. In case of doubt, contact Lab Leadership. You are never allowed to reveal anything about the analysis that the author is conducting, and that you are reproducing, to anybody outside of this group. You must never put the code, the article, or the data on a location where others outside of this group could access it Bitbucket within the aeaverification project is OK, do not attempt to make a repository public (even if it may seem convenient not to have to enter your login etc.) Remove the files from your laptop as soon as you are done with it (after git push, of course) You may remove them from CISER nodes, but those will be cleansed later Do not email or otherwise disseminate (twitter, facebook, snapchat, whatever) the files received, or any other information about the papers "],["checklist.html", "B Setup Checklist B.1 Accounts you will need to sign up for (action required) B.2 Accounts you will be signed up for (no action required) B.3 Software to install on your laptop B.4 Text editor vs. Word processor B.5 Availability and Suggestions B.6 Note B.7 Help", " B Setup Checklist B.1 Accounts you will need to sign up for (action required) [ ] CISER account (for computing access) - Select &quot;Apply for Research account&quot; and list Lars as a sponsor.

The difference: a text editor creates simple text files, without fancy formatting. If you are creating code in Stata, Matlab, or Rstudio, you are using a customized text editor, sometimes called an IDE = &quot;Integrated Development Environment&quot;. That is OK. But remember that all such program code is a straight text file. General purpose text editors can view and edit them all, although they may lack some of the fancy features that make programming easier in the dedicated IDE.
