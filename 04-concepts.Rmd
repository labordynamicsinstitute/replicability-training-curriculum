# Basic Concepts

The goal thus of the reproducibility activity is 

- to verify provenance of all data sources, 
- to verify the availability of all computer code to produce analysis files from data sources, and to produce tables, figures, and in-text numbers from analysis files,
- to verify that the available code actually reproduces the analysis files, tables, figures, and in-text numbers.

We therefore need to define a few concepts:

- what is a data source, and how can one verify its provenance?
- what is analysis data?
- how can we verify computational reproducibility?
