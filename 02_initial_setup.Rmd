# (PART) Preliminary Tasks {-}

# Pre-requisites 

Most students with some **prior experience with statistical software** can effectively reproduce and assess articles. In economics, most articles use either Stata or Matlab.

Students should be comfortable working on a variety of computers, including their own, and be flexible with respect to the location of computing. If you don't know what that means, you'll find out during training!

# Pre-training tasks {#pre-training}

We ask that trainees accomplish a few tasks prior to the first training session. Please do the following:

- Review our [Privacy Policy](#privacy), where you will recognize how we handle your privacy, and the privacy of authors. 

## View

- View [my recent talk on the background of the lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLoeNzOApFk)), including what we do, and why we do it.
