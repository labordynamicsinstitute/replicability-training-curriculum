## Using openICPSR Projects Prior to Publication

Typically the AEA Data Editor team will access code and data provided by authors that is stored on [openICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea). 

> Cornell replicators: You will need to set up an openICPSR account using your Cornell email.

### Basics of openICPSR

- Authors will create a draft deposit that contains the replication archive for their paper.
- Each deposit is identified with a six digit number.
- You will download the project and commit the code (but not the data) files to the corresponding Bitbucket repo.

### Downloading a project

- Log on to the openICPSR website by clicking on the `Code provenance` link in Jira
- If you get an error, the project has probably not been shared with you. Contact your supervisor.
- If successfully logged on, you will be able to download the project from the "more" menu:

- Do not upload files to the projects.
