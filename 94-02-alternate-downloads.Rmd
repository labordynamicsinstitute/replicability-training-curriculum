## Alternate sources of data

We sometimes encounter replication packages that reference Dataverse or Zotero. Download those as they are found on those sites. Extract them as you would the openICPSR downloads, with the directories named as follows:

- Dataverse: Use the latter part of the DOI. E.g., if the Dataverse package's DOI is `https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RE5ZVI`, name the directory `DVN-RE5ZVI`. 
- Zenodo: Use the latter part of the DOI. E.g, if the Zenodo package's DOI is `https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7041706`, name the directory `zenodo-7041706`.
