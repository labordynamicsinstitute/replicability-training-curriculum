## Text editor vs. Word processor

You want to use a **text editor**, not a **word processor**. The difference: a **text editor** creates simple text files, without fancy formatting.

If you are creating code in Stata, Matlab, or Rstudio, you are using a customized text editor, sometimes called an **IDE** = "Integrated Development Environment". That is OK. But remember that all such program code is a straight text file. 

General purpose text editors can view and edit them all, although they may lack some of the fancy features that make programming easier in the dedicated IDE.
